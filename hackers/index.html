      The themes in Karen Russell's "Vampires in the Lemon Grove" set it apart
      from other vampire stories by breaking away from traditional vampire
      stereotypes and exploring the damaging effects of addiction. <br />
      To start, the story breaks lots of stereotypes. As people know, Vampire is
      depicted as a monster which is a mythical creature that sustains its life
      by eating the essence, generally in the form of the blood of the living.
      As an appearance, they are usually wearing the classic European wearing a
      tailcoat or silk hat and a black cloak with a collar. Also, vampires are
      used in lots of stories. For example in the movie named “Hotel
      Transylvania”, the protagonist who are Dad, and his daughter is depicted
      as a Vampire. They have same as the normal vampire setting, that they can
      change their form to bat and fly, it becomes ash when the sun hits and has
      big sharp fangs. Therefore, in the movie, the daughter’s boyfriend who was
      a normal person who does not have any special powers got discriminated
      against by lots of monsters and also had lots of challenges in the movie.
      However, compared to other stories, "Vampires in the Lemon Grove" did not
      use the same settings as other normal Vampires and gave them a change.
      First, Vampires are not portrayed as monstrous, evil creatures but as
      individuals with complex emotions, desires, and relationships. Same as
      normal people, they went to a movie theater for a date. Second, the story
      does not cling to the traditional portrayal of vampires as romantic
      figures. Normally, the story has a vampire showing a desire for love
      between a vampire and a human like the “Hotel Transylvania”, which could
      not be fulfilled because the Vampire is usually immortal. However,
      instead, this story focuses on the relationship between the two vampires.
      Third, In the story Vampires don't necessarily require blood to survive.
      When Clyde met the Maghreb, he learn that blood drinking was not necessary
      for them. Other than normal vampires, they were able to live without
      drinking blood, so they decided to stay in the lemon grove. Nevertheless,
      This setting consequence tragedy ending by Clyde showing the damaging
      effects of addiction when he loses control. Because he was not able to
      sustain his desires by drinking lemon, he kills Fila who is a young
      Italian girl who works in the lemon grove and drinks her blood and this is
      shown in the quote “While in town, Clyde runs into Fila and loses control,
      feeding on her to the point that he kills her”. Cyled might be quite fond
      of Fila because he thinks that Fila knows he is a monster but never says
      anything, which can make Clyde value their relationship and wants to
      maintain it despite his true nature. This situation showed that addiction
      can surpass people's feelings and occur violent actions. Same as the
      story, there are lots of examples in the real life. In Korea, there was a
      single-parent family and the father was raising an infant. However, he
      isolates the baby in the room alone and plays a game. This is similar to
      the story because they both had a significant variation, but they were not
      able to sustain and violate morality. Furthermore, the story also explores
      the idea of finding healthier ways to cope with addiction. Clyde and
      Magreb's discovery of lemons as a substitute for human blood can be seen
      as a metaphor for finding healthier ways to cope with addiction. <br />
      In conclusion, "Vampires in the Lemon Grove" by Karen Russell is a unique
      take on the traditional vampire story that breaks many of the stereotypes
      and also shows the violence by addiction
